htauth
------

Simple C replacements to emulate the Apache project's htpasswd and
htdigest programs for servers without the Apache binaries installed
(if you're using nginx, lighttpd etc).

Building on GNU/Linux requires the UNIX crypt library (which should be
there anyway), and there's a simple Makefile included to build the
binaries with gcc.
